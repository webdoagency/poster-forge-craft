/**
 * Deterministic auto-fit text sizing.
 *
 * Given a bounded box and a text element, this shrinks the font size (via a
 * bounded binary search over a fixed number of iterations) until the text
 * fits within the box height and the max line count, tightening line-height
 * once it approaches the minimum size. It never grows the font size back up
 * mid-run, is not driven by animation frames or timers, and produces the
 * same output every time for the same input, so it is safe to run in a
 * layout effect (before paint) and safe to reuse for export snapshots since
 * export reads the already laid out DOM.
